The Audio Reactive LEDs was my final project of choice for ECE 1895. This project utilizes an ATMega328P microcontroller to control LED output by measuring the amplitude of an audio signal. PCB files are contained for easy replication of this project.

Table of Contents:
/Software/ - contains all files used for the ATMega328P microcontroller

/LED Frame/ - stl files for each individual part of the LED frame as well as the stl file for the entirety of the frame

/Hardware/ - Contains PCB files and schematic for the first design used for JLCPCB, as well as the SERC design.
FINAL_Prototype_Circuit.SchDoc is the schematic used in breadboarding my design for the final prototype.
